Social Media harvests

Scripts for handling data from social media networks using APIs, as opposed to www-based harvesting.

## Twitter

Harvest of Twitter-posts and subsequent harvest of resources referenced from tweets (images, webpages...).
The harvesting of the ressources and the writing of the data to WARC is done with the [Wget tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).
